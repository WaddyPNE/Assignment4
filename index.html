<h3><u>Skills</u></h3>


          
        <p class="text-container"><u><b>Computing</b></u><br><br><i>College has taught me to use a wide range of software and I have an excellent working knowledge of all Microsoft office works in particular Excel Spreadsheets and Word for Windows, which I use on a daily basis at my current employment. I am able to operate advanced formulas in Excel and also have vast experience of using macros, I consider my knowledge of Excel to be one of my strengths due to extensive use of the programme and varied courses. I have a vast experience of Access and the ability to learn and adapt to different databases I feel confident that I could quickly learn and understand any unfamiliar or new software.</i></p>
    
          <p class="text-container"><u><b>Communication & Teamwork</b><br><br></u><i>An integral part of my current employment involves working with members of other teams as well as my own team and it is important that all communication is accurate and comprehensible. I am required to provide information to the members of my team on a regular daily basis either by email, telephone, or face to face. It is also essential in my position to communicate effectively with teams within the company regarding queries so that they may be solved quickly and efficiently.</i></p>
 
          <p class="text-container"><u><b>Analytical skills and Time management</b></u><br><br><i>I have good analytical skills which I have developed further given the nature of the work that I have been doing, as analysing information and producing KPI reports have played a big part in my previous positions. I also possess good time management skills and the ability to manage an intense workload under time pressure. In previous positions I have had weekly and month end duties set to strict deadlines so it has been important that I work to a schedule to ensure all tasks are completed on time as well as managing additional ad hoc responsibilities in between.</i></p>
